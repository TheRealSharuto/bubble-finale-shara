Hello world, my name is Shara Belton (Shar - ruh Bell - tin)! I'm a 21 year old woman on the internet, blogging her experiences away. I mean... what else do you do when you do not have social media?

I am dedicated to blogging my journey into tech during a  difficult and rigorous career change. Originally, I was a Kinesiology major. However, after self-teaching how to code for a year, I decided to go back to school for a Computer Science major in Fall 2022! It is personally important to me that I learn a good foundation of computer science, in case I ever want to branch out of Software Engineering or leave the States.

On top of that, I have other dreams outside of Software Engineering! 

1. I want to gather the equipment and credentials to one day film workout videos on YouTube. 
2. I want to get financially stable enough to travel the world!

Other than that, I am proud to say that I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community (hi fellow pansexuals!), and have many other interests outside of coding!

1. Anime, Manga, Webtoons
2. Succulents
3. Drawing
4. Dance (Kpop, Hip-Hop)

And the list goes on! 

Anyways, enough about me! Tell me about yourself in the comments below or contact me to send me a request or message.

See ya in my next post!
